    /// DESIGN NOTE:
    /// Shared textures are bound via global shader properties and are intentionally
    /// treated as cooperative, process-global resources.
    ///
    /// Multiple systems or assemblies may attempt to load and register the same
    /// SharedTextureMeta. This is explicitly supported:
    ///
    /// - The global shader property is treated as the single source of truth.
    /// - The first system that binds a texture to a given shader property ID wins.
    /// - All subsequent systems detect and reuse the already bound global texture.
    /// - No ownership, locking, or forced overwriting is performed.
    /// - Type mismatches are validated and reported at load time.
    /// - This ensures idempotent, order-independent initialization across assemblies.
    ///
    /// This behavior is by design and must not be "fixed" by introducing singletons
    /// or forced reloads.
